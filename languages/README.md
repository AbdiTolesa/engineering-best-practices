This section of the Engineering Best Practices dives a little into each of the scripting and markup languages that are used to engineer our WordPress websites, these include [CSS](css.md), [HTML](markup.md), [JavaScript](js/), and [PHP](php.md).

Please take the time to read this section carefully and try to retain as much of it as you can â€” it will serve you well in future projects. Do your best to follow the standards describe here when writing code for one of our projects. There are going to be many ways to solve the same problem, we don't expect or want everyone to think the same way. However, by following the same set of standards we can make it easier to maintain our code and create efficiency as it moves through the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
